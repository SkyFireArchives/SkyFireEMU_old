This repository will no longer be updated. The address has changed. You can merge the new repository into your existing repo.
We changed over to an organization now. This was the only way it could be done. Yes it's kinda stupid but it's the way GitHub does it.
The new address is https://github.com/ProjectSkyfire/SkyFireEMU 
Checkout is now git@github.com:ProjectSkyfire/SkyFireEMU.git
