//--> Phase2 at 50% HP,

/*Malygos himself is not targetable during this phase, it will end when the adds he spawns are all killed. However, he does continue to play a part in the encounter.
During this phase he drops anti-magic zones onto the ground the raid MUST stand inside of, it reduces magical damage taken by 50%. They shrink over time, so it's important that your raid moves to each new one he drops.
Throughout the phase, he will deep breath doing ~4k damage per second, unless you are standing inside of the anti-magic zone.
The way the fight works during this phase is there are NPCs riding around on disks in the room. There are two types of mobs, Lords and Scions.
The Lords will move down onto the group, and need to be tanked (They will one-shot a non-tank). After they die, they drop a disk that a raid member can mount onto, which allows them to fly, to attack the Scions that do not come down to the ground.
It is recommended to let melee take the first disks, then ranged. As those mobs die, they also drop disks, which allows the rest of your dps to get onto them.
The Scions will continually cast Arcane Blast on random targets on the floor, which is mitigated by the anti-magic zones. While mounted on a disk, you will not take damage.
After all of the NPCs riding on the disks die, the players on the disks need to dismount as Phase 3 is about to begin.*/
